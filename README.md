# HLC - Hermes Led Control
Provides an easy way to control your device leds in a hermes environment. It is highly customizable and beginner-friendly

**Do not simply clone the master and use it unless you know what you are doing!!** Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/project-alice-assistant/HermesLedControl/wiki) for all the information about how to install and use

It currently supports this hardware:
- Respeaker 2-Mics
- Respeaker 4-Mic Array
- Respeaker Mic Array V1
- Respeaker Mic Array V2
- Respeaker 6 Mic Array
- Respeaker core V2
- NeoPixels ring
- Matrix Voice
- Matrix Creator
- Google AIY
- Any leds on gpios

I don't have the budget to buy every other devices just to implement them. If you are a manufacturer, **I appreciate hardware donations :-)**, they will be used wisely in my voice assistant projects.

Sometimes I get thirsty, so I still appreciate a beer now and then, feel free to refresh me: https://paypal.me/Psychokiller1888
